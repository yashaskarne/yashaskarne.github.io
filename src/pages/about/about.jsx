              My work sits at the intersection of branding, UX, and UI. I take
              projects from problem framing to final execution, shaping how a
              product looks, feels, and communicates. I care about structure,
              clarity, and systems that scale, not just visual output.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve worked on brand identities, product concepts, and real-estate
              brand experiences, often owning projects end to end. My approach
              balances aesthetics with user needs and business goals.

          <h1>Where it started</h1>
          <p>Before design became digital for me, it was physical.</p>
          <p>
            There was a pause where I spent my time drawing. Paper, pencil,
            charcoal. The grain of the paper mattered. Pressure mattered.
            Mistakes stayed visible. I couldn’t clean things up or move fast.
            That slowness taught me how to look properly. How to build depth
            over time and stay with something even when it felt unresolved.
          </p>
          <img src={work_abt} alt="" />
          <h1>
            That way of working never left. It shows up in how I design today.
            I’m comfortable starting slow, staying with uncertainty, and letting
            things take shape through attention and care.
